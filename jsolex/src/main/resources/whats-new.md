## Message to US citizen and far right supporters

**If you support Trump or any other party close to the far right, I ask you not to use this software.**

My values are fundamentally opposed to those of these parties, and I do not wish for my work, which I have developed during evenings and weekends, and despite it being open source, to be used by people who support nauseating ideas.

Solidarity, openness to others, ecology, fight against discrimination and inequality, respect for all religions, genders, and sexual orientations are the values that drive me.
I do not accept that my work be used by people who are responsible for suffering and exclusion.
If you do, I kindly ask you to review your choices and turn to more positive values, where your well-being does not come from the rejection of others.
